# Sample Hardhat Project


This is a simple Dapp which included facucet contract, simple ERC20 token and AMM swap 

You can go to frontend folder and run dapp which maded with NextJs on your local host using:

npm run dev

Then go to faucet tab and receive your faucet tokens
After that you can make swaps and provide liquidity

*Note that for adding liquidity you need both of pair tokens, so if you haven't USDC you can make swap with faucet token and get some USDC, then try to provide liquidity.
